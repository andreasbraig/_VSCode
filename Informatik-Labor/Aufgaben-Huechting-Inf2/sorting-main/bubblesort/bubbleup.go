package bubblesort

// BubbleUp implements a single iteration of the bubble sort algorithm.
// It iterates over the list and compares each element with the next one.
// If the element is larger than the next one, they are swapped.
// The function returns true if at least one swap was performed.
func BubbleUp(list []int) bool {
	swapped := false

	return swapped
